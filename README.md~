atmega_midi_cv_polysynth
========================

(This is a new clone of my monosynth MIDI>CV that will be modified for polyphonic productions.)

Uses the Arduino MIDI library to operate two x MCP4822 12-bit DAC with internal voltage reference.

Largely based on http://www.experimentalistsanonymous.com/ve3wwg/doku.php?id=analog_synth_midi

Uses 4922 library from http://www.alhin.de/arduino
